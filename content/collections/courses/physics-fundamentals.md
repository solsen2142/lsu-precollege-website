<b>To Prepare For:</b> AP Physics 1, High School Physics<br><br>
<i>Physics Fundamentals</i> is designed to introduce students to algebra-based physics. Students will cultivate their understanding of physics concepts through inquiry-based lessons utilizing hands-on and interactive activities. Students will develop a conceptual understanding of physical processes and laws as they explore topics such as kinematics, dynamics, circular motion and gravitation, energy, momentum, and much more. Students who participate in this course will be ready to ace their physics class in the upcoming year - whether it be AP Physics 1 or a standard physics class.
