<i>Interactive Computing</i> focuses on the nuances of programming for interacting with the real world in two representative areas: autonomous robots and the front end of web applications. Students learn how to code a software model within the realities of physical hardware, how to write test suites, and how to systematically debug their programs. Through fun and engaging projects, students will learn programming-based problem-solving skills, such as teaching robots to navigate mazes and play soccer, developing online web apps to read sensors and control actuators in greenhouses, and automating devices at home with Internet of Things (IoT)
technologies.
