<b>To Prepare For:</b> High School Chemistry<br><br>
<i>Exploration of Chemical Processes</i> provides students a basic understanding of chemical principles and processes. Through interactive and hands-on lessons, students will explore atomic and molecular structures, states of matter, energetics, and stoichiometry of reactions. Students will gain foundational knowledge and develop a sense of chemical process as it relates to the world around them. By the end of the course, students will be prepared for any high school chemistry course in the upcoming year!
