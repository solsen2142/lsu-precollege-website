The <i>Robotics</i> course uses VEX EDR Robotics parts and RobotC software to introduce the student to basic programming as well as problem solving strategies. This course will involve students in the development, building, and programming of robots to accomplish various tasks. Students will work in teams to design, build, and program their very own robots. Topics may include motor speed, gear ratios, torque, sensors, program loops, project documentation, and decision-making.
