<b>For Careers in:</b> Mathematics, Statistics, Finance<br><br>
<i>Virtual Math Circle</i> is designed to provide high school students with the opportunity to conduct mathematical research with guidance from professors and graduate students. Research mentors from many different areas of mathematics will give 1-2 talks in the beginning of the program on their area of research and potential research topics. Once students have heard from all of the mentors, they will choose the topic they are most interested in and devote the remainder of the course to their research. By the end of the program, students will have a completed mathematical research project that they can continue as a science fair project in the fall.
