<b>For Careers in:</b> All Engineering Disciplines<br><br>
This is the virtual version of our <i>Intro to Engineering</i> course. In partnership with the LSU College of Engineering, <i>Intro to Engineering</i> will introduce you to the profession, ethics, and diversity of the field of engineering. You will receive a mailed learning kit of supplies for 15 hands-on projects relating to 10 different fields of engineering. Throughout the course, you will interact virtually with an instructor, teaching assistants, and your peers to learn about each discipline and work on projects. This experience will allow you to explore the differences between each engineering discipline and help you make more informed decisions about future elective choices in high school and selecting your college major.
