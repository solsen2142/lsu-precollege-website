The Recruiting into Engineering High-Ability Multicultural Students (REHAMS) online camp will be held at the same time as the commuter camp. It is for 10thâ€“12th grade male and female students from all backgrounds to learn about various disciplines of engineering during a 5-day online camp. Students will participate in LSU faculty-led engineering 101 sessions and will be guided by current LSU engineering students through a variety of engineering activities. Students will also learn from professional engineers during an Industry Panel session. Students will receive $150 of project materials in the mail and will utilize the engineering design process to build small projects. Reduced fees are available with demonstrated need.
