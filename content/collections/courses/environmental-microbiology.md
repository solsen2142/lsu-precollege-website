<b>To Prepare For:</b> High School Biology, AP Environmental Science<br><br>
<i>Environmental Microbiology</i> explores the relationship between microorganisms and their effects on the environment. In addition to studying the basic principles of environmental science and microbiology, students will examine the intersection of these two fields and the effect of microorganisms on the environment. The course also provides students with the scientific principles, concepts, and methodologies required to study microorganisms and the environment. By the end of the course, students will be prepared for taking high school biology or AP Environmental Science in the upcoming year.
