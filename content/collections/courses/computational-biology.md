<b>For Careers in:</b> Medicine, Biology, Computer Science<br><br>
The objective of <i>Computational Biology</i> is to introduce bioinformatics to high school students with an emphasis on searching and retrieving biological data, sorting the data and finally analyzing the sorted data to draw meaningful conclusions. While maintaining the theme of the central dogma of molecular biology, this project-based course will involve hands-on activities on computers/laptops and will teach students how to relate the outcome of each activity to a real-life medical or biological scenario. Studentsâ€™ progress will be assessed throughout the course by several engaging activities and formative assessments such as activity reports. While moving through this course, students will be introduced to some pre-existing cutting-edge bioinformatics resources and tools. This introduction to computational biology will enhance students' enthusiasm towards the subject and open an avenue for them to explore a career in medicine or bioinformatics.
