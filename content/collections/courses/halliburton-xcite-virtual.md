The LSU Halliburton eXploration Camp Inspiring Tomorrowâ€™s Engineers (XCITE) camp is a 5-day online camp that will be simultaneous with the commuter camp. It is for rising 9th-12th grade female students to encourage them to pursue engineering/computer science/construction management careers. Students will receive $150 of project materials in the mail so they can explore, create, experiment, build, code, design, and compete while learning about a variety of engineering majors. LSU faculty will present Engineering 101 information sessions, and engineering students will coach attendees through activities in small groups. Highlights of the XCITE program: Engineering Design Projects; Introduction to College Life; Panel discussion female engineers; and virtual field trip to a refinery or chemical plant. Reduced fees are available with demonstrated need. <i>Note: There will be a short welcome session on July 11.</i>
