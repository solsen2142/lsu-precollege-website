This is the on-campus version of our <i>Intro to Engineering</i> course. In partnership with the LSU College of Engineering, <i>Intro to Engineering</i> will introduce you to the profession, ethics, and diversity of the field of engineering. You will complete 15 hands-on projects relating to 10 different fields of engineering offered at LSU. Throughout the course, you will interact with your instructor, teaching assistants, and peers to learn about each discipline and work on projects. This experience will allow you to explore the differences between each engineering discipline and help you make more informed decisions about future elective choices in high school and selecting your college major.
