<i>Game Design in JavaScript</i> introduces a broad array of topics related to game design and digital media through project oriented programming of graphics, audio, and hardware applications. The motivation for this course is to provide a basic introduction to computer programming in JavaScript through the lens of game design. Students need little to no prior programming experience. The course is presented in five segments covering an introduction to the basic concepts of coding, three distinct areas in digital media, followed by a final project combining elements of these areas to make a video game. There is a strong emphasis on computer programming tasks throughout.
