In this course, we will cover the basics of JavaScript - one of the most widely-used coding languages available - to learn how to code your own 2D video game. You will program character interactions, set up keyboard controls, add your own soundtrack, and more. At the end of camp, we will have a competition to see who can score the highest on each person's final game. Some programming experience is helpful, but not required.
