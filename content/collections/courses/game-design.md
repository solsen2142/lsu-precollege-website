Have you ever played a game and wished you knew how to make one? In this course, we will cover the basics of JavaScript - one of the most widely-used coding languages available - to learn how to code your own 2D video game. You will program character interactions, set up keyboard controls, add your own soundtrack, and more! At the end of camp we will have a competition to see who can score the highest on each person's final game.
