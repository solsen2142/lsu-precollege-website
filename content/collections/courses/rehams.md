The LSU College of Engineering is proud to offer the REHAMS residential engineering summer camp to qualified high school students. This program gives high school students the chance to explore, create, experiment, build, code, design, and compete in a variety of engineering and college preparatory activities. The camp is held on LSUâ€™s Baton Rouge campus where college faculty and college students interact with attendees through a number of hands-on workshops and activities. The signature event is the week-long "Design Project Competition" in which students compete in teams to design, build, and present a project.
