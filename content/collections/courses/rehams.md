The Recruiting into Engineering High-Ability Multicultural Students (REHAMS) camp is for 10thâ€“12th grade male and female students from all backgrounds to learn about various disciplines of engineering during a 5-day commuter camp. Students will be participating in LSU faculty-led engineering 101 sessions and will be guided by current LSU engineering students through a variety of engineering activities. Students will also learn from professional engineers during an Industry Panel session. The highlight of this camp is the Design Project Competition, where students utilize the engineering design process to build a project while incorporating time, budget, aesthetics, and functionality. Reduced fees are available with demonstrated need. <i>Note: There will be a short welcome session on June 20.</i>
