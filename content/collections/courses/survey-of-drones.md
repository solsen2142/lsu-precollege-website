<i>Survey of Drones</i> uses the fundamental skills learned in LSU’s Pathways Engineering courses to assemble, program, and pilot drones for use in indoor racing. Students will work hands-on to program and pilot drones through an indoor racing course. The course will begin with the basics of flight and signal transmission, then using those basics, students will adjust the programming of their drones to improve mobility and better suit their pilot’s preferences. Each team will program, test, and pilot their drone to see whose is the best!
