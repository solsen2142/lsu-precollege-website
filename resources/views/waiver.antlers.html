	        <p class="lead" style="font-size:1.5rem"><b>Participant Release & Liability Waiver</b></p>

              <p class="lead">The Participant hereby freely, voluntarily, and without duress executes this Release under the terms below: The Participant does hereby release and forever discharge and hold harmless Louisiana State University, Aspire PreCollege LLC, and their successors (the "Organizers") and assigns from any and all liability, claims, and demands of whatever kind of nature, either in law or in equity, which arise or may hereafter arise from participating with the LSU Pre-College programs.</p>

              <p class="lead">Both the Participant and parent/legal guardian should read each of the statements below before submitting their registration.</p>

              <p class="lead"><b>Photographic Release.</b> Participant does hereby grant and convey unto the Organizers all right, title and interest in any and all photographic images and video or audio recordings made by the Organizers during the Participant’s Activities with LSU Pre-College, including, but not limited to, any royalties, proceeds, or other benefits derived from such photographs or recordings. </p>

              <p class="lead"><b>Participation.</b> The Participant agrees to be governed by the rules and regulations of the Organizers. Furthermore, the participant agrees to attend all of the activities and functions associated within the daily program. Illegal activities will be grounds for removal from the camp without refund of tuition. The Participant acknowledges that a failure to be a participant in LSU Pre-College will result in the removal from the program without a refund. The Participant acknowledges that low enrollment in a course is grounds to cancel the course; in this case, Participant is entitled to a full refund of any tuition payments made for the cancelled course. For virtual courses, the Participant understands that the contents of their course's learning kit may be modified in the event that certain items are unattainable for purchase or prohibitively expensive. The Participant agrees to notify LSU Pre-College regarding any necessary accommodations before 15 days prior to the start of their selected course or program.</p>

              <p class="lead"><b>Medical Treatment.</b> For on-campus programs, the Participant is aware that they will be given emergency medical treatment as needed if the parent cannot be reached for consent. The Participant authorizes the Organizers to render medical services as necessary through the use of the University Infirmary, local doctors, and hospitals. The Participant understands that the Organizers do not assume any responsibility for or obligation to provide financial assistance or other assistance, including but not limited to medical, health or disability insurance in the event of injury or illness. </p>

              <p class="lead"><b>Field Trips.</b> For on-campus programs, the parent or legal guardian of the Participant grants permission for the student to visit chaperoned excursion sites that may be included depending on their program. Furthermore, the parent or legal guardian of the Participant grants permission for transport in a state or LSU employee-owned vehicle or rental vehicle and grants release from any and all liability relating to the Participant’s presence as a passenger.</p>

              <p class="lead"><b>Assumption of Risk.</b> The participant hereby expressly and specifically assumes the risk of injury or harm in the Activities and releases the Organizers from all liability for injury, illness, death, or property damage resulting from the Activities. For virtual programs, because participation is remote, LSU is unable to supervise camp participants.  The parent or guardian of the Participant in a virtual program acknowledges responsibility for supervising the Participant while engaged in camp activities and ensuring that caution is exercised, instructions are followed, and appropriate safety equipment is used.  The parent or guardian further acknowledges that there are inherent risks with performing certain camp activities, depending on the program, including but not limited to working with tools, chemicals, and open flames.  Safety and supervision are the responsibility of the Participant and their parent or guardian.</p>


              <p class="lead"><b>Indemnification Agreement.</b> The Participant and parent/legal guardian agrees to release, hold harmless and indemnify the Organizers, their agents, representatives and employees from all claims, damages, other liabilities for injuries or death to the Participant or any and all costs, expenses, and/or attorney fees, investigative costs, or any and all expenses incurred.</p>

              <p class="lead"><b>Other.</b> The Participant expressly agrees that this Release is intended to be as broad and inclusive as permitted by the laws of the State of Louisiana, and that this Release shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the States of Louisiana. The Participant agrees that in the event that any clause or provision of this Release shall be held to be invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such clause or provision shall not otherwise affect the remaining provisions of the Release which shall continue to be enforceable.</p>

              <p class="lead">By submitting a registration for any LSU Pre-College program, the Participant and the parent/guardian agree that they have read, understood and executed this Release as of the above date.</p>
