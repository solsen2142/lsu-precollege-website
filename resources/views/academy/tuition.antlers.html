				<p class="lead">The health and well-being of our students, employees, and the LSU community are a priority for LSU Pre-College Summer Programs. We are committed to providing a safe learning environment for everyone. Students and employees are required to follow all health and safety guidelines, policies, and protocols established by Louisiana State University and LSU Pre-College Summer Programs as well as state and federal laws and regulations.</p>
				<p class="lead">LSU continues to follow all CDC and state guidelines for health and safety and is doing everything possible to prevent the spread of COVID-19 on campus. Since the pandemic is a fluid situation, all information is subject to change if the state of the pandemic changes at LSU or in Louisiana. Visit lsu.edu/roadmap for the most up-to-date information regarding COVID-19. Below are the safety procedures we will implement at LSU Pre-College this summer:</p>
				<ul class="lead mb-0" style="text-align:left; font-size:1rem">
					<li>
						<b>Face Coverings</b><br>
						Students and employees are required to properly wear face coverings for the entirety of the program except when actively eating or drinking. Face coverings will be strictly enforced.
						<br><br>
						Face coverings are required in all LSU spaces. LSU Pre-College will provide one LSU-branded cloth face covering to each employee and participant. Please note, face shields are not substitutions for face masks. If you choose to wear a face shield, it must be in combination with a face mask.
						<br><br>
						Failure to wear a face covering would mean a participant is in violation of the Student Code of Conduct or an employee is in violation of workplace policies and may be removed from the program and campus.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Daily Symptom Checker</b><br>
						Students and employees will be required to complete the daily symptom checker and present their results to be admitted to campus every day they are on campus. The daily symptom checker will be sent via text message or email and requires respondents to take a one- to two-minute assessment of their symptoms.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Daily Temperature Checks</b><br>
						LSU Pre-College students and employees will be required to undergo daily temperature checks and will only be permitted on campus with temperatures below 100°. If students or employees have a temperature greater than or equal to 100°, they will not be allowed on campus without a negative COVID-19 test result and having been without a fever for 24 hours.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Physical Distancing</b><br>
						Students and employees should maintain physical distancing of six feet whenever possible. Classrooms will be arranged to maximize physical distancing. Physical barriers will be placed in areas where it is difficult to maintain physical distancing.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Handwashing & Hand Sanitizing</b><br>
						Students and employees should wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, if handwashing is not feasible, use hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol. Hand sanitizer will be available in all classroom spaces. Demonstration of proper handwashing technique will be provided to students and staff.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Coughing/Sneezing Etiquette</b><br>
						Students and employees should cough or sneeze into a tissue or the inside of their elbow rather than their hands. This will help to minimize the spread of germs as you touch doorknobs and surfaces. Demonstrations of proper sneezing etiquette will be provided to students and staff.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Sanitation & Cleaning</b><br>
						Intensified cleaning has been implemented on campus according to CDC guidance, and cleaning protocols are being updated as new information is released by the CDC and others.
						<br><br>
						Building services custodial staff received updated training on the proper disinfecting training techniques required for this enhanced cleaning. The custodial staff will be conducting normal routine cleaning of bathrooms, hallways, offices, common areas, classrooms, teaching areas, break rooms, and conference rooms.
						<br><br>
						In addition, the custodial staff will clean frequently touched surfaces on a daily basis. The minimum frequency of cleaning for high touch areas includes:<br>
						-Twice daily for elevators, stairways, and restrooms<br>
						-Once daily for doorknobs, light switches, and break rooms
						<br><br>
						At minimum, classrooms will be cleaned once a day, including doorknobs, light switches, chairs, and desks, as well as other hard surfaces.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>COVID-19 Testing & Exposure Protocols</b><br>
						Students and employees who receive a positive COVID-19 test result or who have been exposed are required to report their positive case through the daily symptom checker and adhere to the <a href="https://lsu.edu/roadmap/health/symptoms.php">LSU Isolation and Quarantine Protocols</a>.
